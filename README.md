Our Interactive dashboard is split up into four questions that we each visualized.

# Ryan Bell:
Communication Channels: What is the most common method by which residents submit their 311 requests?

# Yahya Diallo:
How long does it usually take to close or review a request?

# Kimberly Aurora Vargas:
What are the most common types of complaints in NYC in 2024?

# Maximus Walton:
Which agency receives the most 311 requests, and what complaints do they handle most frequently?

# Our separate visuals are broken up into our names with code following. Our entire interactive dashboard can be found under the app.R file.
